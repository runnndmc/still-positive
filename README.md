# OVERVIEW

 **Still Positive** is a pet project that is coming to life before - our - EYES. Still Positive as a whole will aim to create connection, conversation and comedy around those with and without chonic illness.
 
 To create connection, I will be hosting a weekly podcast entitled Still Positive that will have guests on the show that are or living around people with chrnoic illness. This is a weekly podcast that will be a video and audio recording lasting anywhere from 45 min to 1 hour and will be housed on this Still Positive site. In order to increase connection I will also aim to have a public forum where people can discuss topics, ask questions, and connect with others.
