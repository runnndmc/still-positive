# OVERVIEW

 **Still Positive** is a pet project that is coming to life before - our - EYES. Still Positive as a whole will aim to create connection, conversation and comedy around those with and without chonic illness.
 
 To create connection, I will be hosting a weekly podcast entitles Still Positive that will have guests on the show that are or are living around people with chrnoic illness. This weekly podcast will be a video and audio recording that will last anywhere from 45 min to 1 hour and will be housed on this Still Positive site. In order to increase connection there will also be a forum where people can discuss topics, ask questions, and connect with others. 


## MVP Goals

- Design mobile first 
- Have the podcast be shown on site
- Have a donate button
- Have an about me section with articles


### Server (Back End) <!-- omit in toc -->

- Have a **RESTful JSON API**.
  - Build a **Ruby on Rails** server, exposing RESTful JSON endpoints.
  - Build a database with at least 3 tables:
    - There must be at least 1 association between your tables. (1:m _or_ m:m)
  - Utilize **Rails** to define models for interacting with the database.
  - Implement working generic controller actions for Full CRUD (`index`, `show`, `create`, `update`, `delete`) between your non-User tables 
    - _Note that if you choose to do Authentication, CRUD on your User table does not count toward this requirement._

## Step 2. Pitch Your Idea

   - **Features:** A full feature list for your MVP app.
   - **Goals:** The overarching goals for your project.
   - **Challenges:** An explanation of the challenges you expect to face with this project.
3. **MVP:** An overview of your MVP, including the minimum, need-to-have features of the app.
   - **Client:** Wire-frames, component hierarchy, component breakdown, and time-frame estimates.
   - **Server:** Data architecture, ERD model, and API endpoint documentation.
   - **Dependencies:** A full list of all libraries, frameworks, etc.
